# Notebooks for testing

## Running
Running the notebooks is easiest by using docker. Make sure you have docker installed on your system

```bash
$ docker build . -t ntnu-process-mining-notebook
$ ./run.sh
```
A URL will be printed to your terminal, which you can use to access the notebook in your browser.
